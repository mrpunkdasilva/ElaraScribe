# The C4 Model for Software Architecture

The C4 model is a lean, developer-friendly approach to visualizing software architecture. Created by Simon Brown, it consists of a set of hierarchical diagrams that describe a software system at different levels of abstraction, each tailored to a specific audience.

The name "C4" refers to the four core diagram types: **Context**, **Containers**, **Components**, and **Code**.

The central idea is to create a map of your software. You can zoom in and out to get different levels of detail, telling a cohesive story about your system's architecture to various audiences, from non-technical stakeholders to software developers.

## The Levels of Abstraction

1.  **Level 1: System Context Diagram** - The highest level of abstraction. It shows your system as a black box in its environment, interacting with users and other systems.
2.  **Level 2: Container Diagram** - Zooms into the system to show its high-level building blocks or "containers."
3.  **Level 3: Component Diagram** - Zooms into an individual container to show its internal components.
4.  **Level 4: Code Diagram** - Zooms into an individual component to show its implementation details.

## Why Use the C4 Model?

- **Improved Communication**: It creates a common language for describing architecture, bridging the gap between technical and non-technical teams.
- **Clarity and Consistency**: It provides a simple, consistent, and easy-to-understand set of diagrams.
- **Collaborative**: The notation is simple enough for collaborative sketching sessions on a whiteboard.
- **Focus on Storytelling**: It helps you tell the story of your architecture at different levels of detail.
