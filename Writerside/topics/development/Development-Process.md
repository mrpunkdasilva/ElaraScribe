# Development Process

This section outlines the development process followed by our team. A clear process ensures that we work efficiently, maintain high quality, and deliver features iteratively.

## Methodology

Describe the development methodology used (e.g., Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall). Explain why it was chosen and how it is applied in the project.

**Example (for Scrum):**
*We use Scrum with two-week sprints. Each sprint begins with a planning meeting to prioritize the backlog and ends with a review and retrospective to demonstrate progress and identify areas for improvement.*

## User Stories / Requirements

If applicable, explain how requirements are gathered and managed. You can use a table to list high-level user stories or epics as examples.

| ID      | Description                                      | Priority |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| US-XXX  | As a [user role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]. | High     |
| US-YYY  | As a [user role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]. | Medium   |
| US-ZZZ  | As a [user role], I want to [action], so that [benefit]. | Low      |

## Team Organization

Describe the structure and roles of the development team. This helps new contributors understand who to contact for different issues.

| Role                | Responsibilities                                     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Product Owner       | Manages the product backlog and prioritizes features.  |
| Lead Developer      | Oversees the technical aspects of the project.       |
| Frontend Developer  | Implements the user interface.                       |
| Backend Developer   | Develops the server-side logic and APIs.             |
| QA Engineer         | Ensures the quality of the product through testing.  |

### Team Members

You can optionally list the current team members and their roles here.

Explain how the team stays synchronized. Do you have daily stand-up meetings? Do you use a project management tool for reporting?

**Example:**
*Our team holds a daily stand-up meeting at 10 AM to discuss progress, plans, and any blockers. We also use a [Project Management Tool] to track tasks and progress.*
