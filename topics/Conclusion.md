# Conclusion

This project successfully achieved a significant portion of its initial objectives, with the complete implementation of key functional and non-functional requirements. We managed to develop core functionalities and integrate various components, representing a significant step forward in product delivery.

Despite time constraints and technical challenges, such as the learning curve associated with new tools and technologies, the team demonstrated resilience and collaboration in overcoming these obstacles. The adoption of an agile methodology, such as Scrum, was crucial for the project's success, enabling effective task distribution, continuous reviews, and ongoing improvements throughout each sprint. This methodology also helped us manage deadlines and foster a structured and productive work environment.

Throughout the project's execution, we acquired valuable skills, including teamwork, the practice of conducting regular meetings, and the ability to handle deadlines and adversities. These learnings will be essential for future projects and professional careers.

In summary, although some functionalities may still be pending, the project showed great progress, delivering a functional product aligned with prioritized requirements. This work served not only as a technical exercise but also as an experience of growth and learning for everyone involved.
