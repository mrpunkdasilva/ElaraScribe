# Software Engineering

Software engineering is the systematic approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software systems. In this context, the organization of our project's technical documentation is essential to ensure the quality, maintainability, and evolution of the system.

As stated by Pressman (2010), "technical documentation is the backbone of software engineering, as it captures the requirements, architecture, implementation, and operational procedures of a system."
