# Information Architecture

The information architecture (IA) for our project's software documentation should be designed to provide a clear and intuitive structure for organizing and disseminating technical knowledge. According to Rosenfeld and Morville (2015), IA "involves the design of the structure and navigation of an information space to facilitate task completion and content access."

This information architecture structure will help ensure that our software project documentation is understandable, accessible, and effective for developers and other stakeholders.

### Wireframes / Prototypes

This section should include visual representations of the user interface, such as wireframes or prototypes. You can link to external tools (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD) or embed images directly.

> [Link to project's design files or prototype]

#### Example Wireframe: [Feature Name]

[Description of the wireframe and its purpose]

<!-- You can embed images here or link to external wireframe tools. Example: -->
<!-- ![Example Wireframe Image](images/your-wireframe-image.png) -->

### Database Design

This section should detail the database structure, including Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), Logical Data Models (LDM), and Physical Data Models (PDM). You can include SQL schemas for tables.

#### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

[Description of your ERD]

<!-- You can embed images here or link to external ERD tools. Example: -->
<!-- ![ERD Image](images/your-erd-image.png) -->

#### Physical Data Model (PDM)

[Description of your PDM and table schemas]

##### Table: `[TABLE_NAME]`

```sql
CREATE TABLE [TABLE_NAME] (
   [COLUMN_NAME] [DATA_TYPE] PRIMARY KEY, -- Description of column
   [ANOTHER_COLUMN] [DATA_TYPE],          -- Another column description
   -- Add more columns as needed
   [FOREIGN_KEY_COLUMN] INT,
   FOREIGN KEY ([FOREIGN_KEY_COLUMN]) REFERENCES [REFERENCED_TABLE]([REFERENCED_COLUMN])
);
```
