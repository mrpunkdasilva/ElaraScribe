# Information Architecture

The information architecture (IA) for our project's software documentation should be designed to provide a clear and intuitive structure for organizing and disseminating technical knowledge. According to Rosenfeld and Morville (2015), IA "involves the design of the structure and navigation of an information space to facilitate task completion and content access."

This information architecture structure will help ensure that our software project documentation is understandable, accessible, and effective for developers and other stakeholders.
